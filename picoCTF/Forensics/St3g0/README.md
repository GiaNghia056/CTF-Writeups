## Solution
I search Google about `$t3g0` and found this [LSB Image Steganography](https://medium.com/swlh/lsb-image-steganography-using-python-2bbbee2c69a2)</br>

And I use Python to decode the image</br>

Then, I got this
`picoCTF{7h3r3_15_n0_5p00n_a9a181eb}$t3g0`</br>

Flag:`picoCTF{7h3r3_15_n0_5p00n_a9a181eb}`
